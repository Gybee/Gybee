Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Godbless Lucky Osu**

**I am an Aspiring Cloud Computing Solutions Architect.**

I am a highly organized and detail-oriented professional who is passionate about using technology to solve complex problems. My primary interest is in cloud computing, particularly on the AWS platform. I am working towards becoming a proficient Cloud Solutions Architect so that I can help businesses address challenges such as scalability, flexibility, cost optimization, security and others, as well as societal challenges like healthcare and unemployment.

My experience as an intern in a Molecular/Medical Laboratory and subsequent role as a Medical Laboratory Analyst have helped me develop excellent communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and analytical skills. I am a resourceful, proactive, and self-managing team player who thrives in a collaborative environment. In both my positions as an Intern and Laboratory Analyst, I collaborated with colleagues to streamline workflow, resulting in an over 20% increase in efficiency.

Notably, I emerged as the winner of the Unity Bank business plan entrepreneurship challenge during my National Youth Service in Kano State Nigeria, displaying my entrepreneurial awareness and strategic thinking ability.

I am driven by a desire to streamline processes and achieve transformational results. My goal is to design innovative cloud-based solutions for various problems in different business sectors. I am currently upskilling and eagerly await the opportunity to embark on my tech career, where I envision making a significant impact as a Cloud Solutions Architect.
